## Quick Start Guide

The Yale Stata scheme provides a quick set of options for modern-looking graphs from Stata using Yale colors. The scheme is intended for use by the Yale Economic Growth Center's Research Team when designing visualization for presentations and social media.

## Installation

The scheme is not currently ready for installation. When it is, a package file will be uploaded to the Github repository to allow downloads via the *net install* command.

## Attribution

The Yale scheme was written by Aaron Wolf. Bugs can be reported via the repository at Github (https://github.com/aarondwolf/scheme-yale). Questions can be directed to aaron [dot] wolf [at] yale [dot] edu. 

This scheme used the user-written scheme *cleanplots* as a base, with alterations made to reflect Yale's colors and stylistic preferences. *cleanplots* was created by Trenton Mize, and documentation can be found at https://www.trentonmize.com/software/cleanplots. *cleanplots* was itself influenced by Daniel Bischof's very excellent *plotplain* scheme, documentation for which can be found at https://www.stata-journal.com/article.html?article=gr0070.
